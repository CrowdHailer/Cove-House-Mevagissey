      <p>Cove House was at one time the harbour masters house. It is easy to see why. The coming and going of fishing boats into and out of the harbour is quite absorbing. The views are equally impressive at night, the lights of the village, around the harbour and of more distant villages  are just as engaging, in good or bad weather, a storm can be impressive with waves not uncommonly breaking over the outer harbour light house.</p>

      <p>Cove House is a soundly built former fisherman's cottage, which had been owned by the same family since it's construction in the 1890's. It was completely refurbished over the summer of 2012, being updated to a high specification but still retaining much of the original character. The house sits well above the road on Polkirt Hill, with steps leading up to the entrance porch.</p>

      <p>From the first floor landing are the stairs to the third floor bedroom. This room runs the full length of the house and has three single beds. There are two velux windows opening to the rear. On the front elevation is the original dormer style roof window. Again the views from this window are the same as from the rest of the house. This room is probably suited to and would be enjoyed by children.</p>

      <p>Like most houses in Mevagissey Cove House is situated on a hill. Hence be prepared for relatively steep but short walks to go anywhere in the village. Also like most places there is no off road parking. However there is parking in a quiet culdisac 250 yards walk away or parking in one of the village car parks slightly further away. There is also a pull in almost opposite from where you can off load luggage.</p>

      <p>Mevagissey is a good place from which to explore Cornwall's many attractions. Two of the county's premier attractions are close by, the Lost Gardens of Heligon is forty minutes walk and the Eden Project twenty minutes drive. Also Lanhydroc House and gardens is close to Bodmin, about forty minutes drive. Many of the coastal towns and villages are worth a visit, St.Mawes being very popular. But Mevagissey its self has numerous attractions. The harbour is literally a stones throw away, with sight seeing or fishing boat trips available. The aquarium is well worth a visit as is the 00 gauge Mevagissey Model Railway. Polkirt Hill forms part of the South West Footpath. There is a good choice of beaches within a short drive and the restaurants, pubs and cafe's offer a very good range of food, many of them naturally specialising in sea food.</p>
